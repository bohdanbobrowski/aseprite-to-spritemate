# Aseprite to Spritemate

Script for aseprite to export c64 sprites to <a href="https://github.com/Esshahn/spritemate">Spritemate</a> json format.

Script is very simple, and rather experimental but should work at least for multicolor sprites (hi-res is not tested).

## Sprite requirements

- size: 12\*21 for multicolor or 24\*21 for hi-res
- colors: indexed colors is required, and ofc "Commodore 64" pallete

## Installation

Just download lua file and copy to your scripts folder (in Linux it's located in '~/.config/aseprite/scripts'), then start Aseprite and enjoy!
